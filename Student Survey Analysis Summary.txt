This project aims to analyze a student survey data set using Power BI to extract meaningful insights. The report includes various visualization techniques such as tabular visualization, matrix visualization, funnel chart, pie chart, scatter plot, and sand dance plot. The report also provides data access restriction for different users and a Q&A feature to answer specific questions. The report highlights the relationship between different types of purchases and store settings, and the dashboard is scheduled to refresh six times every four hours. To use the report, the user needs to clone or download the repository and open the Power BI project file (.pbix) with Power BI Desktop. The necessary data sources and credentials to access them should be available. Users can use slicers and filters to interact with the visualizations and explore the data.
